    Hello there, my name is Kabir Bose. I am a student at Ontario Tech
    University studying IT and Network Security. I am currently in my second
    year. I love programming mostly with JavaScript and Python, sports like
    soccer and swimming, as well as playing video games! My favourite food is
    shawarma but tacos are a close second. I also love Batman and my favourite
    movie of all time is "Batman Begins".
    <br />
    <br />
    Here is a little intro to myself!
